# Tips and Troubleshooting for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Everytime I'm looking for a troubleshooting guide for Ubuntu I can never find a direct solution. I always have to search in many **articles** and **How To** guides, and gather information from different sources to resolve my problems.

So, in order to help other people to save their time I decided that everytime I fix an issue I'll create an article showing the step-by-step I used to resolve it, and I hope that these direct instructions can be helpfull to you!!
